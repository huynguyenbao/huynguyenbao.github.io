In the 14th century, an English philosopher and theologian, named Willam of Ockham, stated that "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem", which translates as <span style="color:red"> Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity </span>. This principle is also known as **Occam's razor**. If there are multiple hypotheses compatible with an observed dataset, Occam's razor then advises us to choose the simplest. Although the conclusion seems hasty, it can be explained and understood as **a consequence of Bayesian inference**, a method of updating beliefs based on evidence.
