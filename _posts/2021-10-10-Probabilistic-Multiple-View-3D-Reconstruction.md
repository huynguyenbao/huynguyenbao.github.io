There are numerous methods for reconstructing a real object into mesh such as voxel carving which processes independently the input images or structure from motion. However, in this blog, we would like to introduce to you another solution for this ill-posed inverse computer vision problem. This method is volumetric approach, where each voxel is assigned two probability values for being in or out of 3D object. Let's start.

The detail of blog I wrote is in [here](https://graphicsminer.github.io/mathematics/2021/10/10/Probabilistic-Multiple-View-3D-Reconstruction.html).
