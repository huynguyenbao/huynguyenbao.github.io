This blog presents you a light weight real time segmentation and pose tracking method which only uses monocular RGB camera and can run with multiple objects and robust to occlusion. The whole process is just mathematics which makes the output of each step predictable and allows us to have insight for further improvement.

The detail of blog I wrote is in [here](https://graphicsminer.github.io/mathematics/2022/10/01/Real-Time-Monocular-Segmentation-and-Pose-Tracking.html).
