**Optical flow** is the pattern of appearance objects motion in image, between two successive frames caused by the movement of objects or camera. It is a 2D vector field, where each vector represents a displacement or movement of feature from first frame to second frame (see the below image).

Formulation and Assumption
-----

The problem:

Being given 2 successive frames $I_1$ and $I_2$, we need to find the motion vector $(dx, dy)$ for each pixel.

To solve this problem, [Horn & Schunck](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~zhang/caam699/opt-flow/horn81.pdf) had made some assumptions:

1. **Images are captured in ambient light**: This means that the intensity of pixels do not depend on position of the camera.

2. **Spatial Motion**: Pixels do not move fast.

3. **Spatial Correlation**: All neighbors of one pixel also have the same motion as the center one.

After having some assumptions, the problem can  be solved this easily.

The first assumption let we have the equation: $I(x, y, t) = I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt)$

The second assumption means that $dx$, $dy$, $dt$ are very small, so that we can approximate $I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt)$ with the first order of Taylor series:

$I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt) \approx I(x, y, t) + \nabla I_x dx + \nabla I_y dy + \nabla I_t dt.$

Because we are considering 2 successive frames ($dt = 1$), we have:

$I(x, y, t) = I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt) \approx I(x, y, t) + \nabla I_x dx + \nabla I_y dy + \nabla I_t.$

$\rightarrow \nabla I_x dx + \nabla I_y dy + \nabla I_t \approx 0.$ (1)

Where $\nabla I_x$, $\nabla I_y$, $\nabla I_t$ are gradient of image respect to x-axis, y-axis, and time.

$\nabla I_x (x, y)= I_t (x + 1, y) - I_t (x - 1, y)$.

$\nabla I_y (x, y)= I_t (x, y + 1) - I_t (x, y - 1)$.

$\nabla I_t (x, y)= I_{t + 1} (x, y) - I_t(x, y)$.

To find $dx$, $dy$ in equation (1), we need at least 2 equations, and the last assumption will help us.

In the third assumption, all neighbor of pixel will have the same motion. So that, we can assume that $3\times3$ region around pixel will have the same motion. Now we have 9 equations, so we can solve equation (1).

$$\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    I_{x1} & I_{y1} \\
    I_{x2} & I_{y2} \\
     ...   &   ...  \\
    I_{x9} & I_{y9} \\
\end{array}\right]

\left[\begin{array}{c}
    dx \\
    dy \\
\end{array}\right] =

\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    -I_{t1} \\
    -I_{t2} \\
    ...     \\
    -I_{tn}
\end{array}\right]
$$

The equation above can be considered as a liner system: $Ax = b$ with $x = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    dx \\
    dy \\
\end{array}\right]$.

There ara a lot of methods used to solve this equation: Close form, Pseudo Inverse, [Least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares), [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination), [Jacobi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) and [Gaussâ€“Seidel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method#:~:text=In%20numerical%20linear%20algebra%2C%20the,a%20system%20of%20linear%20equations.). Or even, you can utilize [SVD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjeOmOz9jSY) to solve.
