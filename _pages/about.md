Hi! I am a Research Engineer at Graphicsminer.

My research interests are in problems of extracting **intrinsic information** of images including *geometry* and *BRDF parameters* (**inverse rendering**). I am also fond of *numerical optimization techniques* and would like to apply them into deep-learning-based solutions to accelerate the rate of convergence and relax the need for ground-truth. Current problems I am working on are SLAM, 3D Reconstruction, 3D Tracking and Rendering.

I received BE in Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology in 2021.
